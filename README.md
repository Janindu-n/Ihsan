# Grid App Project

## Overview
This project is a grid-based application built using Tkinter in Python. It allows users to create a grid, populate it with person objects, and perform clustering operations to analyze distributions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library

### Setup
1. Ensure Python and Tkinter are installed on your system. Tkinter is included with Python in most installations. If it's not, you can install it via your package manager.

2. Clone the repository or download the project files:
   ```bash
   git clone [URL to repository]

   python main.py


###Features
Grid Creation: Define the size of the grid (up to 6x6).
Person Management: Add and edit person objects within each grid cell with attributes like age, health status, and time to reach.
Random Distribution: Randomly distribute person attributes across the grid.
Clustering: Analyze the grid to identify clusters based on the person's attributes.


###Usage
Start the application.
Enter the desired grid size and click "Create Grid".
Use "Randomize Distribution" to populate the grid or manually edit each cell.
Apply "Initial Clustering" to see the distribution of weights across the grid based on predefined rules.
